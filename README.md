# ICSTestRepo
This is a test repository for ICS department. The README file describes how to create repositories and has a link to a video on youtube that can prove useful.

The link to the video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds

The steps described in the textfile "guide.txt" are enough to help you to create a repository failry easily.
Before that, however, I should mention that it is better for you to download Git Bash which is a command prompt. Just search for it on Google and you can find it.
