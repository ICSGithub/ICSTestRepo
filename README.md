However, the steps described below are enough to help you to create a repository failry easily.
Before that, however, I should mention that it is better for you to download Git Bash which is a command prompt. Just search for it on Google and you can find it.

Step1: You can click on the ICSGithub icon and choose "New Repository".
Step2: Choose a name for your repository and provide a description. The repositories that you can create are now just "public" since we are using the free version. 
Step3:Click on "Initialize this repository with a README so you can clone the repository to your PC. You can choose what a suitable format for gitignore and a license if you wish. Now, just clikc on "Create repository".
Step4: After it is done, open the Git Bash. 
Step5: On the repository page, you can see the HTTPS clone URL option. This is how you can copy the repo to your PC. Choose the icon next to the address which says: "Copy to clipboard".
Step6: On your Git Bash, go to the folder you wish to import the repo and type :"git clone (paste the address you copied on the repo page in Step5). Press Enter. Now the Repo folder has been created in your designated location.
Step7: Navigate to the folder on Git Bash using the "cd" command and type: "vim README.md". Press the Insert key. Now you can edit the README file and provide useful information for your repository.
Step8: You can step out of the editing environment by pressing the "escape" button twice so you can type on the lower part of the command screen. Then type: ":x" That way, the README file has been saved.
Step9: You can type "git add README.md" to add the README file to the repo on the website.
